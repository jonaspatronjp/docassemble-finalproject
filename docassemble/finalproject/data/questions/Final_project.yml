  GUILTY PLEA WAIVER
  I wish to enter/change my plea on the charge(s) ${charges} from not guilty to guilty. In accordance with s. 606(1.1) of the Criminal Code of Canada, I have been advised by Student Legal Services of Edmonton of the nature and consequences of such an action.
  
  1. I understand that by entering a plea of guilty I am giving up my right to have a trial.
  
  2. I understand that entering a guilty plea is final and cannot be changed later.
  
  3. I understand that by entering a plea of guilty I am admitting the essential elements of the offence.
  
  4. I understand that a plea of guilty may result in a criminal record which may affect my ability to get certain jobs and travel to other countries.
  
  5. I understand that the Court has complete control over any sentence imposed following the entering of a guilty plea and it is not bound by any agreement made between Student Legal Services of Edmonton and the Prosecutor. No representation and/or guarantees have been made by Student Legal Services of Edmonton.

  My decision to enter/change my plea was made freely and voluntarily.
